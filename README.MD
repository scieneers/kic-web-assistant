### Build and push Docker images locally
Before pushing the docker image you need to be authenticated docker via `gcloud auth configure-docker europe-west3-docker.pkg.dev`.

If you're working with a mac that is using an arm64 architecture, you specifically need to build a docker image based on an [amd architecture for cloud run](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66920645/exec-format-error-when-running-containers-build-with-apple-m1-chip-arm-based).


# Moodle
To access content from Moodle, you need access to Moodle courses via the REST API. To set up the integration, do the following steps:
0. Get admin access to moodle.
1. Enable Web Services: _Site Administration_ -> _General_ -> _Advanced Features_ -> _Enable web services_
2. Enable REST Protocol: _Site Administration_ -> _Server_ -> _Web Services Manage Protocols_ -> Enable REST protocol
3. (Optional): Create a technical new user/roles
4. Create a new external service _Site Administration_ -> _Server_ -> _External services_. Give it a name and enable _Enabled_, _Authorized users only_ and _Can download files_ (under _Show more..._).
5. Add the user as an _Authorised User_ to the external service.
6. Add the following functions to the external service: 
    - 
    -
7. Create a token for the user and external service under _Site Administration_ -> _Server_ -> _Manage tokens_. This allows you to authenticate against the REST API.

You can try it out with a GET request against this url (swap TOKEN for your token und FUNCTION against the function to test):
